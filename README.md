# Digital Wasteland README

## About Digital Wasteland

Digital Wasteland is my personal website, a digital playground where I share my projects, thoughts, and creative endeavors. It's a space where I can experiment with new ideas and showcase my work in a unique and engaging way.

## Tools Used

- **Figma**: For designing the user interface and user experience of the website. Figma allowed me to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to visualize and refine the design before diving into development.
- **Git**: For version control, ensuring that I can track changes, manage different versions of the project, and collaborate efficiently.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the repository and managing the project's codebase. GitHub provides a centralized platform for version control, collaboration, and deployment.

Feel free to explore the repository and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
